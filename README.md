# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project
**Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset containing information on Nashville housing data. The primary goal was to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and usability by addressing missing values, splitting combined address fields, standardizing data formats, and removing duplicate entries.

**Objective**

To clean and organize the Nashville housing dataset to enhance its usability for downstream analysis, including:

  -Normalizing property and owner address data.
  
  -Standardizing binary values (e.g., "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No").
  
  -Removing duplicate records and unused columns to improve data integrity.

**Purpose**

This project provides a cleaned and structured dataset that can be readily used for analysis or visualization in future projects.
